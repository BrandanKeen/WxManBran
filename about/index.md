    This site is connected to a live Weather Data Dashboard. During landfalling hurricanes,
    a truck-mounted weather station streams various meteorological parameters to the site in real time.
    Connectivity is maintained via a Starlink satellite dish to avoid cellular outages.
    These observations provide ground truth and real-time updates, improving critical timing and
    operational decision-making for emergency management agencies and utility providers.

  <div class="about-section__content">
    <p>Hi, my name is Brandan Keen, and welcome to WxManBran.com. I built this site to be easy to navigate, informative, educational, and genuinely useful. It started in May 2025 as a bare GitHub repository to show prospective employers my Python work and data visualizations (you can still see that here: <a href="https://github.com/BrandanKeen/hurricane-field-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>). Since then, it has grown into the beginnings of something I believe only God could have inspired me to start.</p>
    <p>My passion for weather began when I was five. From the back of my parents’ minivan, I saw tornado damage from the 1998 Central Florida Tornado Outbreak in Winter Garden, Florida. Those scenes stuck with me, and whenever a thunderstorm built near my elementary school, I would panic and cry, sometimes asking the office to call my mom so I knew she was okay.</p>
    <p>In 2004, everything changed. Hurricane Charley roared through Punta Gorda as a strong Category 4, with wind gusts of 105 mph recorded at Orlando International Airport. My house, just northwest of the airport, took intense impacts, and I missed three weeks of school because of power and grid outages. This experience sparked a deep fascination with tracking hurricanes, which grew even more when Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne hit Florida about three and six weeks later, respectively. I grabbed my parents’ old JVC camcorder (not waterproof), covered it with a hand towel, and “reported” outside in winds that were maybe 30 mph at most.</p>
    <p>The next year, 2005, I printed plotting sheets from the National Hurricane Center every morning, marked each storm’s latitude and longitude, shaded watches and warnings with colored pencils, and kept a log of every advisory number, wind, pressure, and movement. I didn’t realize the season would become record-breaking at the time, but by the end I was worn out from tracking so many storms.</p>
    <p>In 2010, I attended the University of North Florida on a baseball scholarship and, after a few transfers, graduated from Flagler College with a B.A. in Business Administration in 2015. In 2016, while still chasing a professional baseball career back home, I felt pulled to intercept Hurricane Hermine, the first U.S. landfalling hurricane since Wilma in 2005. Hermine was a Category 1 with 85 mph winds, but it was my first real taste of field work and it planted the seed that if I wanted to do this safely and successfully, I needed a meteorology degree.</p>
    <p>In 2020, after hanging up my cleats, I went back to school. I took online community college classes in 2021, then enrolled at Florida Institute of Technology in 2022, completing my B.S. in Meteorology in May 2025. While studying, I balanced classes with intercepts of Hurricanes Debby, Helene, and Milton during the 2024 season, this time with a weather station mounted on my truck to capture real data inside the storm.</p>
    <p>Looking ahead, my goal is to intercept and gather data from as many landfalling hurricanes as I can, keep improving this site, and share updates on the tropics that can help ease anxiety while providing clarity and truth. I feel incredibly blessed to pursue what I love, and I hope something here encourages you, teaches you, or simply connects us through a shared respect for weather.</p>
