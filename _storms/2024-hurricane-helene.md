# Hurricane Helene (2024)

Helene formed in the northwestern Caribbean on September 24 and rapidly intensified over the exceptionally warm Gulf of Mexico before making a destructive Category 4 landfall in Florida's Big Bend. The hurricane's fast forward speed spread hurricane-force gusts, damaging storm surge, and prolific rainfall far inland through the southern Appalachians.

## Overview

- **Storm Intensity:** Category 4 at landfall
- **Max Winds:** 140 mph (120 kt)
- **Formation:** September 24, 2024 over the northwestern Caribbean Sea
- **Landfall:** 0310 UTC September 27 near Perry, Florida (≈10 miles SW)
- **Minimum Pressure:** 939 mb at landfall

## Timeline

1. *September 24:* Tropical storm forms in the northwestern Caribbean and moves toward the Gulf.
2. *September 26:* Rapid intensification over the Gulf; becomes a major hurricane by evening.
3. *Early September 27:* Landfall in Florida's Big Bend as a Category 4 hurricane; life-threatening storm surge.
4. *September 27–28:* Races inland and weakens; dissipates over Tennessee on September 28.

## Impacts

- **Storm surge:** 12–16 ft inundation in parts of Florida's Big Bend, with severe damage around Keaton Beach.
- **Wind:** Fast forward speed spread hurricane-force gusts far inland, toppling trees and causing massive power outages across Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
- **Rain and flooding:** Catastrophic freshwater flooding and landslides across western North Carolina and the southern Appalachians.
- **Tornadoes:** At least 33 tornadoes while Helene remained tropical (39 including post-tropical reports).
- **Fatalities:** At least 249 deaths in the United States (175 direct, 71 indirect, 3 pending classification).
