  <h2>Built for RAPIDâ„¢ Updates</h2>
  <p><p>
  This site is connected to a live Weather Data Dashboard. During landfalling hurricanes,
  a truck-mounted weather station streams various meteorological parameters to the site in real time.
  Connectivity is maintained via a Starlink satellite dish to avoid cellular outages.
  These observations provide ground truth and real-time updates, improving critical timing and
  operational decision-making for emergency management agencies and utility providers.
