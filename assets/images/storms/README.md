# Storm card images

Place storm card artwork in the per-storm folders below. Uploading a file here
on its own does **not** make it appear on the site. After copying in the image,
update the corresponding `_storms/<storm>.md` front matter with a `thumbnail`
path (for example,
`thumbnail: /assets/images/storms/2024-hurricane-helene/front-card.jpg`). Once
that front-matter value is set, the Previous Storms cards will render the
artwork automatically during the next build.

Current storm directories:

- `assets/images/storms/2024-hurricane-helene/`
- `assets/images/storms/2024-hurricane-milton/`
