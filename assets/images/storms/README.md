# Storm card images

Place storm card artwork in the per-storm folders below. After uploading an
image, update the corresponding `_storms/<storm>.md` front matter with a
`thumbnail` path (for example,
`thumbnail: /assets/images/storms/2024-hurricane-helene/front-card.jpg`) so the
Previous Storms cards render the artwork automatically.

Current storm directories:

- `assets/images/storms/2024-hurricane-helene/`
- `assets/images/storms/2024-hurricane-milton/`
